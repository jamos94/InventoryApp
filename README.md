The user can scroll through items. The third screen allows the user to add, delete, or update current inventory. Navigation is controlled through a back arrow at the top left of the application. There is no menu being there are few screens and functionalities included. 

When preparing to code this app, I organized the application by activities first to ensure easy navigation. Finally I created the UI and then went back and added the backend code for functionality. This ensured simple navigation and kept development rolling smoothly.

I tested the code through each interval of coding. This ensured that errors were found quickly through development. Finally after developing the front and back-end,
